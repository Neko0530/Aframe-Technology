Movie Genre Classification
Project Overview

This project aims to classify the genre of a movie based on its plot description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The dataset used includes various movie descriptions and their associated genres. The main objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately assign a genre to a movie based on the provided plot summary.
Features

    Text Preprocessing: Includes cleaning the movie descriptions by removing stop words, tokenization, and other NLP techniques.
    Vectorization: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and word embeddings are used to convert text data into numerical features.
    Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are tested for genre classification.
    Visualizations: Word clouds are generated to highlight the most frequent words used in the descriptions for each genre.

Dataset

The project uses a movie dataset containing multiple features such as:

    GENRE: The movie's genre.
    DESCRIPTION: The movie plot summary used for predicting the genre.

You can find the dataset in the /data folder.

Key Steps in the Project

    Data Preprocessing:
        Handling missing values.
        Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, etc.).

    Feature Engineering:
        Using TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical format.
        Exploring word embeddings for advanced feature extraction.

    Model Building:
        Several classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM) are trained and evaluated.

    Visualization:
        Word clouds are generated for each genre to visualize the most frequent words.

Results

The classification models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best performing model is fine-tuned and tested for genre prediction on unseen data.
Future Work

    Explore deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for better accuracy.
    Expand the dataset with more movies and genres for improved generalization.
